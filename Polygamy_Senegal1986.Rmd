# Introduction

Senegal is a country full of rich culture, deeply rooted in faith and filled with literary giants like Mariama Ba, Ousmane Sembene and Leopold Senghor. With the use of descriptive statistics (qualitative and quantitative data). I argue that a compelling narrative here is not solely qualitative or quantitative. I try to balance the two parts of descriptive statistics by looking at Polygamy in Senegal during the 1980s. This report aims to link the story, *So Long a Letter* about the main character, Ramatoulaye, and her attitude experience with Polygamy. Then to compare the ideas touched on the many letters Ramatoulaye writes to her friend Aissatou with the data from the Senegal DHS report from 1986 and possibly give some context to why the author of the book was writing about Polygamy the way she does.

From my reading of the novel, I had picked up that the union of Polygamy stems from both religion and culture. Religion because Ramatoulaye and many of the characters within the book practice Islam, they often recite the Qur'an, the main character's husband, Modou Fall, had asked the Imam to officiate the wedding. In the novel itself, Ramatoulaye questions her religion and opposes what she must do, like remarrying her younger brother-in-law, who had another wife. Culturally, Polygamy is practiced within the book by the characters' husbands (Tamir, Daouda, Mawdo, and Modou) seeking other wives; there was no mention of a woman seeing multiple husbands.

I had chosen the DHS final report from Senegal 1986 because of how close (time-wise) the two significant artifacts for this report are. The book was written and published in French in 1979, but the English translation came out in 1981. Polygamy statistics were collected by DHS's final report data in 1986. Still, within the data, I noticed a row within one of the polygamy tables provided in the final report that draws on the ESF (Senegal Fertility Survey) conducted in 1978 [@Sen1986]. When researching this topic, I found no other sources comparing fiction with a report that had done this type of work before. Mariama Ba's *So Long a Letter* is a semi-autobiographical novel on Polygamy. She voices the main character's concern with Polygamy and how it has ruined her relationship with her husband. From the novel biography of the author Mariama Ba within the novel it mentions that she is: "A pioneer of women's rights, she became involved in several Senegalese women's organizations. Her commitment to eradicating inequalities between men and women in Africa let her write *So Long a Letter*" [@citenovel].

Also, from the biography: "A schoolteacher and inspector by profession, Ba promoted the crucial role of the writer in a developing country. She believed that the 'sacred mission' of the writer was to strike out 'at the archaic practices, traditions and customs that are not a real part of our precious cultural heritage'"[@citenovel]. I mention this last quote because Ramatoulaye is also a schoolteacher whose goal is to be the best example for her kids and teach about her culture.

This report would not have been able to have been produced if it was not for the statistical programming language "R" [@citeR]. In addition, a unique tool that has helped me convert the pdf images into the text to grab polygamy data was thanks to "magicK"[@citemagicK]. 

One final note I should mention for the DHS final report, it was written in French. So I had many options to go about translating the document. Still, given the time and financial restraints, I had opted to translate the text after it was extracted using the "magicK" package to translate the text using the built-in translator in Microsoft Azure. So the level of understanding of the documents I engage with throughout our translations and not the original text could cause some minor issues with comprehension. Still, I feel it was a reasonable trade-off.

# Data

- Again thank R again
- DHS asks just three questions to get a sense of Polygamy within the country
- pitfalls can be my French, my reliance on translator
- The Data sources Microsoft Azure Translate, SenegaDHS1986 and Mariama Ba's *So Long a Letter*
- Got to give thanks to the almighty and most powerful R, the tidyr, tidyverse packages for being the pillars for which this research is built upon
- Generate a pointblank (Using https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/)
- possibly generate r package for polygamy data?
- "It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data." From Rubric
- "Journey of the stats not the destination" From Rubric


```{r }

```

# Results

- need to produce data in order to talk about this
- Polygamy is prominent in Senegal
- Many ways to look at polygamy among different demographics (which both chart and polygamy blurb mention)
- Is there a trend to follows polygamy?
- "There should also be text associated with all these aspects. Show the reader the results by plotting them where possible. Talk about them. Explain them. That said, this section should strictly relay results." From Rubric
- "In addition to conveying a sense of the dataset of interest, the data section should include details of the methodology used by the DHS you used, and its key features, strengths, and weaknesses." From Rubric

# Discussion

The text from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) was originally in French, I had first thought to use an API to translate French to English. Given the time and financial constraints, I decided to just use Microsoft Azure translator function and scrap the API. But it would be interesting to impalement an API to translate Senegalese survey data from a more recent year to see if the polygamy trends continue. Another possible stream with this kind of work is to see the male perspective on polygamy through Ousmane Sembene's works like *Xala*.

- Why people practice polygamy?
  -positives to polygamy
  -possible negatives
- Religion in Senegal (Predominately Muslim population)
- How are women viewed in Senegal during 1980's.
- Family and Marriage
- Polygamy, Polygyny and Polyandry (Multiple papers make the distinctions between the three words)
- Connect So Long a Letter with DHS data present
- "What is done in this this paper?" From Rubric
- "What is something that we learn about the world?" From Rubric
- "What is another thing that we learn about the world?" From Rubric
- "What are some weaknesses of what was done?" From Rubric 
- "What is left to learn or how should we proceed in the future?" From Rubric
