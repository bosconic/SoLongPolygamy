# Introduction

Senegal is a country full of rich culture, deeply rooted in faith and filled with literary giants like Mariama Ba, Ousmane Sembene and Leopold Senghor. With the use of descriptive statistics (qualitative and quantitative data). I argue that a compelling narrative here is not solely qualitative or quantitative. I try to balance the two parts of descriptive statistics by looking at Polygamy in Senegal during the 1980s. This report aims to link the story, *So Long a Letter* about the main character, Ramatoulaye, and her attitude experience with Polygamy. Then to compare the ideas touched on the many letters Ramatoulaye writes to her friend Aissatou with the data from the Senegal DHS report from 1986 and possibly give some context to why the author of the book was writing about Polygamy the way she does.

From my reading of the novel, I had picked up that the union of Polygamy stems from both religion and culture. Religion because Ramatoulaye and many of the characters within the book practice Islam, they often recite the Qur'an, the main character's husband, Modou Fall, had asked the Imam to officiate the wedding. In the novel itself, Ramatoulaye questions her religion and opposes what she must do, like remarrying her younger brother-in-law, who had another wife. Culturally, Polygamy is practiced within the book by the characters' husbands (Tamir, Daouda, Mawdo, and Modou) seeking other wives; there was no mention of a woman seeing multiple husbands.

I had chosen the DHS final report from Senegal 1986 because of how close (time-wise) the two significant artifacts for this report are. The book was written and published in French in 1979, but the English translation came out in 1981. Polygamy statistics were collected by DHS's final report data in 1986. Still, within the data, I noticed a row within one of the polygamy tables provided in the final report that draws on the ESF (Senegal Fertility Survey) conducted in 1978 [@Sen1986]. When researching this topic, I found no other sources comparing fiction with a report that had done this type of work before. Mariama Ba's *So Long a Letter* is a semi-autobiographical novel on Polygamy. She voices the main character's concern with Polygamy and how it has ruined her relationship with her husband. From the novel biography of the author Mariama Ba within the novel it mentions that she is: "A pioneer of women's rights, she became involved in several Senegalese women's organizations. Her commitment to eradicating inequalities between men and women in Africa let her write *So Long a Letter*" [@citenovel].

Also, from the biography: "A schoolteacher and inspector by profession, Ba promoted the crucial role of the writer in a developing country. She believed that the 'sacred mission' of the writer was to strike out 'at the archaic practices, traditions and customs that are not a real part of our precious cultural heritage'"[@citenovel]. I mention this last quote because Ramatoulaye is also a schoolteacher whose goal is to be the best example for her kids and teach about her culture.

This report would not have been able to have been produced if it was not for the statistical programming language "R" [@citeR]. In addition, a unique tool that has helped me convert the pdf images into the text to grab polygamy data was thanks to "magicK"[@citemagicK].

One final note I should mention for the DHS final report, it was written in French. So I had many options to go about translating the document. Still, given the time and financial restraints, I had opted to translate the text after it was extracted using the "magicK" package to translate the text using the built-in translator in Microsoft Azure. So the level of understanding of the documents I engage with throughout our translations and not the original text could cause some minor issues with comprehension. Still, I feel it was a reasonable trade-off.

# Data

The sources for this data were heavily reliant on the novel *So Long A Letter* by Mariama Ba and the *Senegal DHS Final Report 1986 (FR34)* which was executed by @Sen1986. Within the DHS report this was the comments made by the authors of the survey:

> *In the DHS, three questions are asked about polygamy. The first is to know whether the woman may or may not live in a polygamous household. Two others allow you to enter the number wives of the current husband (or partner) and the woman's rank in the current marriage if this one is polygamous.* -page 15 of DHS, @Sen1986

This text above can be seen in the original french in the appendix in figure 1 but because I do not have a good command of the french language, I had to also rely on the help of a translator, More specifically the Microsoft Azure translator to translate the text verbatim. This also puts the interpretation of the data at a dis-advantage because rather having a person translate the text to pick up on the tone and nuances of the authors, I have to take the words at face-value so there might have been phases or certain keywords the automatic translator had just spewed from the words it recognizes making the findings more rigid and removed from a readers perspective.

As for the content of the words within the quotation above, we can see the findings of @Sen1986 had decided to ask three questions about Polygamy to fully grasp the extent to which Polygamy was practiced in Senegal. Another point that should be mentioned about this survey was that the DHS final report was published in March 1988 but the data is focusing on the year 1986, this could mean that possibly the data collected within the survey had taken some time to wrangle and present for the reader. But this can also point to how surveys reflect the societies they enumerate, as they are just use snapshots like these surveys to generate strategies and solutions to better help the future generations.

Some of the other tools at my disposal to help with the presentation of the data here today are the Pointblank Validation Checkers @citepointblank, these tables which will be embedded in the appendixes figures 6 and 7 to show the validity to the data I had extracted using @citemagicK, @citeR. @citetidyr and @citetidyverse were for the help of cleaning the data.

-   "It is important to understand what the variables look like by including graphs, and possibly tables, of all observations, along with discussion of those graphs and the other features of these data." From Rubric
-   "Journey of the stats not the destination" From Rubric

```{r extractedtable, echo=FALSE}

sentable <-
senegal_data |>
    gt(
    caption = "TABLE 2.2 PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN CURRENTLY IN THE UNION WHO ARE IN POLYGAMOUS UNION ACCORDING TO CURRENT AGE AND SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS")|>
    cols_label(
      group1 = "15-19",
      group2 = "20-24",
      group3 = "25-29",
      group4 = "30-34",
      group5 = "35-39",
      group6 = "40-45",
      group7 = "45-49",
      total = "Total",
      demographic = "Socio-Demographic"
      )
sentable
```

This table was generated from what I had extracted from the Senegal DHS Final Report 1986 data on Polygamous Unions @Sen1986. The title and overall appearance of this table was gathered from figure 3 within the appendix. Generated using @citegt

```{r summarytable, echo=FALSE}
# code from: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/static-communication.html?q=tab#tables

summary_table <-

                   notes = "Data Source: Senegal DHS Final Report 1986")
summary_table
```

This is a summary table of the whole data frame created from the data from figure 3 within the appendix. The "int_groups" are the designated age ranges within the table extracted table above. The reason of changing the names within the age group categories. Generated using @citemodelsummary.

```{r milieu, echo=FALSE}
plot_milieu <-
  senegal_data |>
    filter(demographic == "Urban" | demographic == "Rural")
 
```
This graph shows the affects of milieu and its relation to polygamy.

```{r region, echo=FALSE}
plot_region <-
  senegal_data |>
    filter(demographic == "West" | demographic == "Centre" | demographic == "Northeast" | demographic == "South")
```
This graph shows the affects of region and its relation to polygamy.

  senegal_data |>
    filter (demographic == "Wolof" | demographic ==  "Poular" | demographic == "Serer" | demographic == "Mandingo" | demographic == "Diaola" | demographic == "Other")
```
This graph shows the affects of ethnic group and its relation to polygamy.

```{r literacy, echo=FALSE}
plot_literacy <-
  senegal_data |>
    filter(demographic == "Cannot read" | demographic == "Can read")

This graph shows the affects of literacy and its relation to ploygamy.

# Results

-   need to produce data in order to talk about this
-   Polygamy is prominent in Senegal
-   Many ways to look at polygamy among different demographics (which both chart and polygamy blurb mention)
-   Is there a trend to follows polygamy?
-   "There should also be text associated with all these aspects. Show the reader the results by plotting them where possible. Talk about them. Explain them. That said, this section should strictly relay results." From Rubric
-   "In addition to conveying a sense of the dataset of interest, the data section should include details of the methodology used by the DHS you used, and its key features, strengths, and weaknesses." From Rubric

# Discussion

The text from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) was originally in French, I had first thought to use an API to translate French to English. Given the time and financial constraints, I decided to just use Microsoft Azure translator function and scrap the API. But it would be interesting to impalement an API to translate Senegalese survey data from a more recent year to see if the polygamy trends continue. Another possible stream with this kind of work is to see the male perspective on polygamy through Ousmane Sembene's works like *Xala*.

-   Why people practice polygamy? -positives to polygamy -possible negatives
-   Religion in Senegal (Predominately Muslim population)
-   How are women viewed in Senegal during 1980's.
-   Family and Marriage
-   Polygamy, Polygyny and Polyandry (Multiple papers make the distinctions between the three words)
-   Connect So Long a Letter with DHS data present
-   "What is done in this this paper?" From Rubric
-   "What is something that we learn about the world?" From Rubric
-   "What is another thing that we learn about the world?" From Rubric
-   "What are some weaknesses of what was done?" From Rubric
-   "What is left to learn or how should we proceed in the future?" From Rubric

# Additional details

Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to enable insight of the population trends of Polygamy in Senegal. Being in the western part of the world, I would hear about Polygamy being practiced in some parts of West Africa but never really knew how prominent polygamy was. Though this data was collected in the 1980s so it may be a bit outdated but I think it is all the more reason to look, to possible give insight to the trends of polygamy in the past.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The data itself was created by "Ndiaye, Salif, Ibrahima Sarr, and Mohamed Ayad. 1988. 1986 Senegal Demographic and Health Survey. Dakar, Senegal: Ministry of Economy and Finance Direction de la Statistique Division des Enquêtes et de la Démographie/Senegal and the Institute for Resource Development/Westinghouse"[@Sen1986]. This was from the reccomended citation from the website [SENDHS1986](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr34-dhs-final-reports.cfm)
    - But I, Nicholas Bosco who is a part of the "World Becomes Data Research School" had been given this task to create the dataset.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - No one had funded me to generate the dataset.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - NA

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Within the data itself it just deals with people and their willingness to share an intimate part of their lives in order to be enumerated. So the enumerator who was collecting said information had a lot of responsibility. Also for the specific data sheet here it deals with percentages rather than number of people.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- TBD
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The data attempts to capture the whole country of Senegal, however within the data itself it is a sample size as it captures only a large percentage of the country. Varying from different demographics woman identify with.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- NA
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- NA
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Yes, Within the data there is there was a comment made about some women who identified within a certain age range who posses one of the desired socio-demographics might not have been significant enough to be mentioned as a percentage, or that there were very few people who fit into a specific category matching the age and their socio-demographic so it was hard to generate a percentage that is a good representation of the country's woman population.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- TBD
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- TBD
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- There are a few errors noted when looking at the data, firstly there can be a possiblity of double counting women if you try to specify the parameters of the question. For example the socio-demographics are divided according to Milieu, Region, Ethnic Group, Instruction and Literacy. But what if i wanted to know about the percentage of women who are in a polygamous relationship from who identify as Wolof, who can read and had a secondary education. The data does not account for that kind of accuracy.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- In order to access the translated data, you would have to have access to a translator software. If you prefer the original french data and you would like to electronically use it at your will, you would need a tool that is able to run OCR on the document in order to import the document. 
	- The links I had used for the data are as follows: [SENDHS1986](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr34-dhs-final-reports.cfm),[R programming language](https://www.rstudio.com), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator/#customer-stories)
	
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- TBD
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- TBD
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- TBD
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- TBD
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- TBD
