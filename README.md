# SoLongPolygamy
This report is about Polygamy in Senegal during the 1980s. The report aims to use both fiction and non-fiction to talk about such a dynamic topic. By relying on the novel *So Long a Letter* by Mariama Ba and the Senegal DHS 1986 (French) Final report, I could provide a glimpse of both qualitative and quantitative data on the subject. 

To retrieve the quantitative data, please refer to The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) [click here](https://dhsprogram.com)

The Final Report for [Senegal](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr34-dhs-final-reports.cfm?csSearch=470106_10) I had tried to find a topic that I was most curious about, in this case, was, polygamy, and it should be noted some Final Reports on the DHS website are not always in English, so the final report text may need some translation if English is your first language. Therefore, I used Microsoft Azure and their translator software to convert the French text (after I had extracted the data from the PDF using the R package 'magicK') into English text.
